# Scope
This repository contains R code that can be used to replicate the results in the paper: ``Non-parametric multiple change-point detection'.

There are two main parts in this repository:

1. The main functions that implement the NPID algorithm. The user can employ either the $L_\infty$ or the $L_2$ mean-dominant norm for the aggregation step. The functions for the either the thresholding-based or the information criterion based decision rules are also provided.
2. The functions for the comparative simulation study.

The scripts for the first part are organised in the folder _Main functions_, while the scripts for the last two parts are organised in the folder _Simulation Study_.
